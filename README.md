# minecraft-book-splitter
This python project uses the "wrap" function from the textwrap module to split a .txt or .md file into chunks of 256 characters, which are seperated by a line of '='. 256 characters is the same size as the page of a book in Minecraft Bedrock edition. This tool is extremely useful for copy and pasting real life text documents into minecraft books.
